== About Me

Dr. Yan is an Assistant Professor of Operations Research in the [https://ise.uw.edu Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering] at [https://www.washington.edu/ the University of Washington, Seattle]. Previously, he was a postdoctoral researcher and a senior data scientist at the [https://marketplace.uber.com/ marketplace optimization group] at Uber where he designed [https://marketplace.uber.com/pricing/surge-pricing rider surge pricing] algorithm. #It balances demand and supply in real-time across 900+ global markets.

He received his Ph.D. from the [http://orc.mit.edu/ Operations Research Center] at [web.mit.edu MIT] in 2017 and his undergraduate degree (with summa cum laude) in [http://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/ Industrial Engineering] from [http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html Tsinghua University] in 2012.

His research centers around transportation and logistics systems, with a recent focus on emerging problems in online platforms. He also has a particular interest in air transportation systems. His work aims to study *fundamental properties* of these problems and propose *(data-driven) practical solutions* for implementation. When analyzing these problems, he is broadly interested in tools from optimization, game theory, stochastic modeling and statistics. 


He teaches graduate- and undergraduate-level foundational courses in optimization and stochastic processes, as well as a topical course in supply and demand analytics.
